\section{Question 1}
Let $n$ be a 3 tuple vector, and given that it is along $V1$. It is trivial that  we can imply:
\[
        n = \frac{[V1_x, V1_y, V1_z]}{[|V1|,|V1|,|V1|]}
\]
where $|V1| = \sqrt{V1_x^2+V1_y^2+V1_z^2}$

Thus n is now known.

By the definition of cross product, denoted as $\times$ here, knowning that $V1$ and $V2$ is non-collinear, we can also derive:
\[
        u = \frac{V2 \times V3}{[|V2 \times V3|,|V2 \times V3|,|V2 \times V3|]}
\]

Finally, it is also trivial that:
\[
        v = u \times n
\]

Therefore u,v,n are now all known.
